Blah blah synopsis blah blah

## Pick a ticket from the backlog

Took a look through backlog, picked out LDEV-467 because it was one I had previously looked at, blah blah priority order

## Reproducing

Well this is easy, it's been triaged properly and has a unit test CFC.  Download it and commit it to a branch on my fork, woohoo.

If no tests, then figure out some reproduction code and create unit test, testbox etc.

## An example debugging a bug 

LDEV-90 could be good for this

## Compile and test

## Commit and create
