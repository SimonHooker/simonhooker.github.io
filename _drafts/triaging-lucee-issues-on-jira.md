So you have some free time and would like to help improve Lucee, but oh no! You dont know any Java.  Well there's always documentation ... isnt that everyone's idea of a good time?  Well good news, there is a vital part of the Lucee issue process that you can turn your attention to ... triage.

What is triage? Put simply it is the process of confirming a bug and providing simple means to reproduce it. Usually this will be done by creating a test suite and attaching it to the ticket. This then allows whoever later decides to work on it to confirm easily that the issue hasn't been fixed by an update since reporting or triage. It also allows confirmation that the issue doesnt later recur.

## Find an issue to triage

Still interested? Great! The let's begin. The first thing you will need is a Lucee environment to test on. Ive already covered setting one up for this purpose [[here]]. Now you need to find something to triage. If you go to issues.lucee.org you will see the [[board name]] board. [[Filter to deployed bugs]]. Have a look through the tickets and find one that interests you. Alternatively you can be selfless and pick one of the more voted for ones.

If you haven't already the register and log in. If you click on the ticket you can blahblah [[how to transition to next stage]].  Its now up to you to triage!

## Read the ticket

See title.  Read it, make sure you understand it.  If uncertain then ask the person that posted the issue questions.  How are you meant to create unit tests to reproduce an issue if you don't understand it?

That's kind of it for this section really.  Read the ticket, that is all.

## Reproduce the problem


## Set up a test suite

## Update the ticket
